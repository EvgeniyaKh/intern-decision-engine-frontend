Review (by Evgeniia Khramova).

What is done well:

- The code is well-structured and follows OOP principles.
- Detailed and clear comments are provided.
- The user receives clear notifications in case of errors.
- The input data is validated, reducing errors and ensuring security.
- The application adapts to the screen size.

What can be improved:

- Violation of SOLID principles:

In DecisionEngine, the calculateApprovedLoan() method performs several tasks at once - data validation, loan calculation logic, and response generation. This doesn't comply with the single responsibility principle (SRP), since the method performs several tasks, which complicates testing and maintaining the code. It is better to split it into several smaller methods, each of which will be responsible for only one task.

Also, the build() function in the frontend part looks quite bulky, it can be divided into separate methods or widgets.

- In the DecisionEngine, it is better to declare creditModifier locally inside the calculateApprovedLoan method and then passed as a parameter to highestValidLoanAmount(). This would be safer.

- Error handling:

In DecisionEngineController, the message in catch (Exception e) could be more informative and user-friendly.

In loan_form.dart, when receiving a response from the backend, it's better to add some protection - a try-catch block should be added and some mechanism for checking the response that the received data matches the expected format.

- Request on every change:

The form sends a request to the API every time a field is changed. This could overload the server. Consider adding a button that sends the request by click or implementing a delay before sending the request (debounce).

- Incorrect display of data to the user:

According to the requirements and main logic, the minimum loan period is 12 months, but the user sees the minimum value as 6 months - this mistake should be fixed.
